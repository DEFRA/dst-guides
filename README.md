# Digital Service Team Guides

## WE ARE MOVING

These guides started out as being something to support a single Digital service team, but then evolved into being a community hub to capture useful info for all digital service teams.

We now have an official home for all development in Defra, not just digital teams at [Software development standards](https://github.com/DEFRA/software-development-standards) (SDS).

As such much of the content here will be migrated to the new project. Eventually DST-Guides will close.

In the interim we ask all new developers; permanent or contractor to check out both repos before they start working. If anything is duplicated or inconsistent between the two, SDS takes precedence.

## Introduction

These guides relate to the work of Digital Service Teams (DST) in the Environment Agency who are building new [Digital by default](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) services.

## About

They cover processes, decisions, how-to's and notes. They are intended to help with onboarding new team members, provide details for contributors, and are part of our efforts to keep our work consistent across the services and projects we build and maintain.

It has been produced as a series of markdown files to make the process of adding and maintaining the documentation as simple as possible. Nothing is fixed and anything documented here is open to change.

It is maintained under source control to cater for this, allowing anyone to make suggestions for improvement via the standard [pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

It is pushed to GitHub to make it publicly accessible and to render the content in a presentable format.

It is heavily inspired by the work of [ThoughtBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides).
