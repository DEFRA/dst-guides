## About

They cover processes, decisions, how-to's and notes. They are intended to help with onboarding new team members, provide details for contributors, and are part of our efforts to keep our work consistent across the services and projects we build and maintain.

It has been produced as a series of markdown files to make the process of adding and maintaining the documentation as simple as possible. Nothing is fixed and anything documented here is open to change.

It is maintained under source control to cater for this, allowing anyone either within the team or outside to make suggestions for improvement via the standard [pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

It is pushed to GitHub to make it publicly accessible and to render the content in a presentable format.

It is heavily inspired by the work of [ThoughtBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides).
