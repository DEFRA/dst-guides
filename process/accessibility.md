# Accessibility

All of our digital services must be accessible to everyone who needs them.

We must research, design, develop and test according to [GOV.UK guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction).

Underpinning this guidance are the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/) which we must follow to levels A and AA. Following these guidelines helps us ensure that people with a wide range of needs, including people who use assistive technologies, are likely to be able to use your service.

Internal services must also be accessible. Approximately 10% of civil servants who have declared their disability status have a disability. [Accessibility guidance for internal services​](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/services-for-government-users#accessibility)

Accessibility should always be built in from the early designs of a service. It is much more expensive to retrofit accessibility later on, as any issues introduced at the early stages will have propagated across the service.

Good accessibility is not just for people with disabilities. It makes the whole service easier for everyone. For example, it can help you submit a form quickly by pressing Enter, or make a keyboard with an "@" sign appear on your phone when typing in an email address.

## Assistive technologies

Many people with access needs use assistive technology. GOV.UK has a [Testing with assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) page with a list of the technologies our services need to work against.

You should familiarise yourself with how a screen reader works to help understand how you should mark up and test your web pages. Two free screen readers are:
* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) for PC
* [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/), built into Mac.

[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) is a great, neutral source on web accessibility and contains cheat sheets for the main assistive technologies.

## Testing for accessibility

Rather than testing for accessibility at the end of a project, we should always quality assure (QA) the early designs up front. A checklist will help with this.

A good first accessibility test is to try navigating round your service using only the keyboard and zoomed in at 200%, using an older browser such as Internet Explorer 11.

For quick accessibility checks, you can use tools such as the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) for Chrome or Firefox. These help to identify around 30% of accessibility issues, such as insufficient contrast or unlabelled form fields.

### Checklists

The following checklists (visible to Defra employees) will help you objectively test a service against WCAG 2.1:

* [Accessibility checklist (spreadsheet version)](https://defra-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/andrew_hick_environment-agency_gov_uk/ESitVYTdWlJBtD2IX7UCvK4BZTWMe0mLjn8JclOrVHRnGw?e=N7X557)

This contains tests on a single page, with cross-references to the relevant guidelines.

* [Accessibility checklist (document version)](https://defra-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/andrew_hick_environment-agency_gov_uk/EQVneSLL2NlLrtNes_8z99kBHx3gZYHWyZ2YoJLZsJnSEg?e=9i2DwM)

Use this version if you want to save screenshots as you go along.

These checklists were based on the [WebAIM checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist).

Once you have eliminated major accessibility issues by testing in these ways, the best insight you can get is by doing research with people who use assistive technologies.
