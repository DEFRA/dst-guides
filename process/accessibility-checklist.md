# Accessibility checklist

Accessibility is about more than checklists. However, a checklist like the one below will give you an objective idea whether your service meets a minimum standard.

The following set of tests is a simplified version of the [WebAIM checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist). They refer to the mandatory Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at level A and AA.

## Navigation

|Number|Test|Common failures|WCAG|Status|
|------|----|---------------|----|------|
|1|Zoom the browser to 200% and navigate through the service.|Content overlaps on zoom or exceeds screen width|1.4.4||
|2|Navigate using only a keyboard. When tabbing, check that it's obvious where the focus lies and that it's impossible to get trapped.|Being unable to tab to buttons or links.|2.1.1<br>2.1.2<br>2.4.3<br>2.4.7||
|3|Check that there are no disorienting changes (such as popups or a loss of keyboard focus) without prior warning. Where hover-over content appears, ensure that the content itself can be hovered over or dismissed, and remains visible until dismissed or no longer relevant.A delete button, which, upon activation, shows an "Are you sure?" popup. A hover-over explanation which disappears when you zoom out to view it.|1.4.13<br>3.2.1<br>3.2.2||
|4|Spot check pages for a "Skip to main content" link at the top (use Shift+Tab), and access it. If there is no link, check that the headings are in a logical structure.|No 'skip' link, or link doesn't work properly|2.4.1||
|5|Check that it is easy to move between sections of the service. A short journey may only require back links and continue buttons. A longer journey may require step-by-step navigation.|Long, drawn out user journey with no easy way to go back and correct errors.|2.4.5|

### Checklists

The following checklists (visible to Defra colleagues) will help you objectively test a service against WCAG 2.1:

* [Accessibility checklist (spreadsheet version)](https://defra-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/andrew_hick_environment-agency_gov_uk/ESitVYTdWlJBtD2IX7UCvK4BZTWMe0mLjn8JclOrVHRnGw?e=N7X557)

This contains tests on a single page, with cross-references to the relevant guidelines.

* [Accessibility checklist (document version)](https://defra-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/andrew_hick_environment-agency_gov_uk/EQVneSLL2NlLrtNes_8z99kBHx3gZYHWyZ2YoJLZsJnSEg?e=9i2DwM)

Use this version if you want to save screenshots as you go along.

These checklists were based on the [WebAIM checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist).

Once you have eliminated major accessibility issues by testing in these ways, the best insight you can get is by doing research with people who use assistive technologies.
