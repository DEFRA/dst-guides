# New projects

N.B. This guide currently only relates to new projects on GitHub.

## Get a repo

Contact **Alan Cruikshanks** or **David Blackburn** for a new repo to be created. They'll need

* A name for the project
* A description
* Whether the repo is to be private or public
* Team or teams to be assigned

**Do not create it under your own user account!** Though repo's can be transferred at a later date, it is simpler and clearer if the repo originates within the [Environment Agency](https://github.com/EnvironmentAgency) organisation on GitHub.

## Protect your branches

Use GitHub's [protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) feature for `master` (and if you're using Gitflow `develop`).

If you've hooked up the repo to some form of CI that updates the status of commits also use the option [required status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-required-status-checks/).
