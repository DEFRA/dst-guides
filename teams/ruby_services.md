A team of awesome furicorns ü¶Ñ dedicated to supporting and improving all Defra digital services built using *Ruby* ‚ù§Ô∏è ('cos it's the best)!

We have chosen to maintain our own repo of guides and information specific to our team in [Ruby Services Team](https://github.com/DEFRA/ruby-services-team), as we also maintain a master list of issues for all the repositories we manage.
