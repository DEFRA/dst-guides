## Checking your work

We use [markdown-spellcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-spellcheck) to check content for spelling errors. We check contributions using `mdspell --en-gb --ignore-numbers --ignore-acronyms '**/*.md'`.

We use [markdownlint](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint) to check the files have a consistent style. We check contributions using `mdl --style md_style.rb $PWD`.

We recommend you install these tools, and then run before before pushing your commits.

## Getting feedback

Feedback will be provided by the team within the PR. Decisions will be documented and reasons given.

We're a team that want to encourage others to suggest ways we can improve. We'll always endeavour to be positive and professional with any comments we make about your contribution, but let us know if you feel we failed.
