## Checking your work

We use [markdown-spellcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-spellcheck) to check content for spelling errors. We recommend you install and run this before making a commit. We will check contributions using `mdspell --en-gb -n '**/*.md'`.

## Getting feedback

Feedback will be provided by the team within the PR. Decisions will be documented and reasons given.

We're a team that want to encourage others to suggest ways we can improve. We'll always endeavour to be positive and professional with any comments we make about your contribution, but let us know if you feel we failed.
