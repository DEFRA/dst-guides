# Renewal window

Upper tier waste carrier registrations incur a charge to register them, and expire every 3 years. However before they expire users have the opportunity to renew them for a lesser charge.

What this page describes is the decisions made and guidance on the 'renewal window', the period during which a user can renew their registration prior to it expiring.

## Current window

The current window is **3 months** prior to the registration expiring. So given the following registration (see [Activation and Expiration](activation_expiration.md) for full details about the activation and expiration period and rules)

- Registration marked active at 14:35 on Mar 25 2015
- Registration officially active from 00:00 Mar 25 2015
- Registration expires 24:00 24 Mar 2018

The period in which the registration would be eligible for renewal is 00:00 Dec 25 2018 to 24:00 Mar 24 2018. As you can see 'month' is not a standard unit e.g. 30 days. It is explicitly 3 months prior to the date of expiry. This means in terms of time some users would have a slightly longer period to renew than others, depending on which months fall in the renewal window.

### The regulations

Previously the service used a 6 month renewal window based on what the legacy system also allowed. This was because the *Controlled Waste (Registration of Carriers and Seizure of Vehicles) Regulations 1991* required us to notify holders of a 3 year registration about renewals 6 months before they expire. The *Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011* removed this provision, and includes nothing that states when renewals can or have to be made.

From March 2017 we as a regulator are required to comply with **Growth Duty** (section 108 of the Deregulation Act 2015). Essentially it requires us to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth (view the [statutory guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/603743/growth-duty-statutory-guidance.pdf)).

Based on this we as a service were advised to allow at least 2 to 3 months for people to renew. To view the full version of the guidance please see the related [Jira task](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/WC-196).
