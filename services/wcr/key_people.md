# Key people

All registrations require details about certain key people for the business or organisation. Who those people are depends on the type of business â€“ for example, partnerships have partners, while a sole trader registration just has a single business owner.

## Number of key people

The number of key people for a registration depends on the business type.

- Partnerships must have at least 2 key people
- Sole traders should only have 1 key person
- There is no maximum number of key people for any business type, except sole traders

## Age restrictions

There are minimum age restrictions for key people:

- Company directors of limited companies must be 16 or older
- Partners of limited liability partnerships must be 16 or older
- Key people for other business types must be 17 or older

[At 16, an individual can legally be a Company Director](https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/appoint-directors-and-company-secretaries). A 16 year old director won't be legally allowed to drive and so won't carry the waste themselves. But another employee of the limited company could still be driving and conducting the (waste carrying) activity under the company registration. We have chosen to apply the same rules for partners of limited liability partnerships.

[At 17, you can legally drive a vehicle](https://www.gov.uk/driving-lessons-learning-to-drive), and so can carry waste as an individual in your own right.
