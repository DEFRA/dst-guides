# Waste carriers renewals

## Overview

Waste carriers, brokers and dealers who have been classified as upper tier. Upper tier registrations are valid for three years. Renewal of an upper tier registration costs £105 compared to £154 for a new one, plus users get to retain the registration number. Hence they are incentivised to renew.

Waster carriers, brokers and dealers who are classified as lower tier have a licence that does not expire, so no renewal is required.

Classification between upper and lower tier is determined by answering a series of questions during registration. Users have the opportunity to answer these questions again during renewal to check they are on the correct tier.

## General business logic

- Only licences due to expire within the next month that are upper tier can be renewed.
- Licences will expire on the day of expiry
- Lower tier licences do not expire
- Renewed licences will keep their existing registration number
- Overseas companies will be able to change their existing organisation type to "Based overseas"
- Any other change of organisation type which means the organisation has become a new legal entity will require a new registration to be made
- Changing the Companies House number of a registration means the organisation has become a new legal entity and will require a new registration
- Editing the partners on a registration *does not* require a new registration to be made
- Changing the registration type from either carrier broker, broker dealer or carrier broker dealer results in an additional £40 charge
